This is a challenge from frontend-mentor that gives a Figma file to try and replicate it as close as possible. It is still a work in progress, but I have a live website with the work I've done on it so far here: https://ecom-audiophile.netlify.app/

The design dimensions given were for desktop at 1440p, tablet at 768px (size of ipad mini) and mobile at 375px (iphone SE). The full challenge can be viewed here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx
